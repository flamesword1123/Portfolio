                <p>Hi, I'm Jacob Bernheim. I am from New York City and I currently attend highschool at Horace Mann School in the Bronx. For as long as I can remember I have been interested in the sciences. Biology has been my passion from a young age, and as I grew up and experienced specific areas of study, like genetics, biochemistry, and microbiology, I fell in love with with the subject. Apart from bio, I am interested in chemistry and physics. I also enjoy studying computer science and programming. I designed this website myself to put to use some of the skills I have learned over the years of my education, both in school and on my own. Feel free to contact me <a href="mailto:bernheimjacob@gmail.com">here</a></p>

                <div class="experience__content">
                    <p>Outside of school I am in the Lang Science Program at the American Museum of Natural History. The program lasts seven years and began before the start of middle school and continues through high school. It meets every other saturday during the school year and three weeks over the summer. A variety of subjects are taught including astrophysics, anthropology, topics in biology, and more. During my time there I have been able to work on a number of research projects with scientists at the museum and my peers in the program. I also am taking an introductory biology course through edX taught by Eric Lander, a professor at MIT and the director of the Broad Institute.</p>
